                        and why it matters, and suggest how we can reform
                        standardization and agree on more humanely-sized specs.

                        First, just a little about me. 

                        Since 2008, I've worked for the Institute for the Study
                        of the Ancient World at NYU.  Directed by Roger
                        Bagnall, it's a center for research and graduate
                        education.  We have a dozen faculty, almost that many
                        visiting scholars, a research library, regular
                        exhibitions, and a bunch of web projects.
                        
                        I write programs for classicists. Classicists with
                        computing chops love XML. XML is great for texts, even
                        small texts of inscriptions.  The study of inscriptions
                        is called *epigraphy*. My boss, Tom Elliott, is an
                        epigrapher.  Digital epigraphers live and breath XML.
                        I deal with XML everyday. Love might be too strong
                        a word for me; I *like* XML. Smart people busted their
                        butts to make a profile of SGML accessible enough to be
                        used on the Web. I appreciate XML.
                        
                        I'm a huge fan of the Web. The Web brings together more
                        creative and productive people than you could possibly
                        hire and manage at a single company and allows them to
                        connect in unpredictably ways.

                        I think the Web community has spoken, and it's clear
                        that what it wants is HTML5, JavaScript and JSON. XML
                        isn't going away but I see it being less and less a Web
                        technology; it won't be something that you send over
                        the wire on the public Web, but just one of many
                        technologies that are used on the server to manage and
                        generate what you do send over the wire.

                        James Clark is the author of Expat, and was the
                        Techical Lead on the XML Working Group. He acknowledged
                        something that was clear to most web developers at the
                        time. That XML's days as the primary wire format were
                        over.

                        There is still plenty of XML on the Web. I read and
                        write RSS (Atom, actually) and KML everyday.

                        first time offer JSON only, or XML as an afterthought.
                        
                        JSON document databases like CouchDB and MongoDB also

                        While Crockford was targeting Javascript, other
                        languages with Map literals are interchangeable with
                        Javascript where JSON is concerned. Python's syntax is
                        practically identical.
                        
                        JSON handles 
                        Replacing XML globally is not one of JSON's design

                    <aside class="notes">
                        This is an actual comment made by an exasperated
                        developer a while back. It has stuck with me. GeoJSON
                        has limitations, yes. But is it harmfully wrong?

                        Next slides: GeoJSON has to deal with two different
                        categories of developers: those who misread or misinterpret
                        the spec and make mistakes (M) and those who attack
                        weaknesses of the spec to demonstrate its inferiority
                        (A).

                        Mark Pilgrim's theory of why specs matter is what I'm
                        talking about here.

                        This particular comment is from a burned M. But the
                        same type of comment comes from As.

                        cluster ballooning had practitioners today. It's
                        a little more seat-of-the-pants than serious
                        ballooning. A little less formal. Enormous fun by all
